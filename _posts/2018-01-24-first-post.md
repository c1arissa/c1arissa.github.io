One of my very good friends suggested that I start my own blog.  I enjoy helping and mentoring others on topics that I'm passionate about.  I've written various tutorials for friends and fellow students who asked for help in topics such as Stack-based buffer overflow attacks, Debugging and Disassembling with Immunity Debugger, generating shellcode with `msfvenom` from the Metasploit-Framework, and more.  At some point I hope to move those tutorials onto this blog to help a wider range of people!  This is the inspiration behind the blog.
